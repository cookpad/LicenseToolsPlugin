    <h3>1. Definitions</h3>

    <p>“Licensor” means any person or entity that distributes its Work.</p>

    <p>“Software” means the original work of authorship made available under this License.</p>

    <p>“Work” means the Software and any additions to or derivative works of the Software that are made available under
      this License</p>

    <p>
      The terms “reproduce,” “reproduction,” “derivative works,” and “distribution” have the meaning as provided under

      works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Works, including the Software, are “made available” under this License by including in or with the Work either (a)
      a copyright notice referencing the applicability of this License to the Work, or (b) a copy of this License.</p>

      perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense and distribute its Work and any resulting derivative works in any
      form. </p>

    <p><b>2.2 Patent Grant.</b> Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Licensor grants to you a

      excluding any combinations with any other materials or technology.</p>

    <p><b>3.2 Derivative Works.</b> You may specify that additional or different terms apply to the use, reproduction,

      limitation in Section 3.3 applies to your derivative works, and (b) you identify the specific derivative works
      that are subject to Your Terms. Notwithstanding Your Terms, this License (including the redistribution
      requirements in Section 3.1) will continue to apply to the Work itself.</p>
